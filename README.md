# ExprJS
ExprJS is a javascript component that allows user to create structured expressions by mouse clicks 
(DOUBLE-CLICK or CTRL+SHIFT+CLICK). It will help developers to add cool features to their web apps.
Potentially, it can also be used as a utility in low-code or no-code development environments.
